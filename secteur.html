                The first reason is the fact that today, <span>30% of active women work in a part-time job, against only 7% of men.</span> If we take this into account and we put the numbers on the same scale of working time, the employment gap falls down to 16.3%.

            </p>
            <p class="explication">
                The second reason is the fact that women donâ€™t usually do the same work than men. Women are mostly represented in <span>domains such as social or education, whereas men are mostly seen in industry, logistic and computing jobs.</span>

                Every profession, having its own supply and demand, make a big difference according to the domain and the jobs.
                <span>By taking this difference into account, the gender pay gap falls down to 12.8%.</span>
