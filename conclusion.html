                A gap on the salary can also be explained by the size of the structure, the age of the employee as well as his experience in the field, his studies and where he comes from. You have to know that even though women follow a lot more courses and get higher diplomas, they are often less represented in sectors seen as “prestigious”. They have equivalent qualifications than men but with less prestigious diplomas. 
                Furthermore, women barely have access to higher jobs like CEO or directors.
